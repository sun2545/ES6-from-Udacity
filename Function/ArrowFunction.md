### confusing syntax
const greet = name => `Hello ${name}!`;
#### you can call the function 
greet('Kwon')

#### if parameter are two or more or zero, you have to use ()
const Hi = () => console.log("hello");
#### result will be
hello

#### two or more
const Icecream = (flavor,cone) =>console.log(`Here's your ${flavor} ice cream in a ${cone} cone.`);
Icecream('chocolate', 'waffle');

=> I can't use (` `) in github inside consloe

#### result will be
Here's your chocolate ice cream in waffle cone.
